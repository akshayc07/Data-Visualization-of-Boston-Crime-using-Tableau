Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ankkur13/boston-crime-data

Summary: Boston is a Massachusetts' capital and largest city. Boston is home to thousands of students who have come from the corners of the world. It is the fastest-growing city in the northeast. After this brighter side, there comes a topic of darker side i.e. crime. Always people's safety comes to priority. I have tried to analyze the dataset to get the insights of the crime which can be a handy source to the people to know the crime rates at different areas. The insights I have targeted are 
•How has crime changed over the years?
•Is it possible to predict where or when a crime will be committed?
•Which areas of the city have evolved over this time span?
•In which area most crimes are committed?


Description:
•Performed data preprocessing of Boston Crime data of 2016-2018 period by using data filters, data interpreter for data cleaning, feature extraction, handling outliers and missing values, Group creation, sets creation.
•Developed worksheets and visualizations to get the insights of the crime with respect to streets, type of crime, crime reporting areas, years, months, etc.
•Generated dashboards using dashboard actions, quick filters, parameters, and sets to handle views effectively.
•Forecasted the rates of the crime for the upcoming year with respect to the type of crime.
